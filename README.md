## Setup

### Spotify Developer Credentials (Required)
1. Go to [Spotify Developer's Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). Log in using your Spotify credentials.
2. Create a new Application. Name it as desired, add any description, and agree to the Terms of Service.
3. Click on 'Edit Settings' and add the redirect URL you've set in your `.env` file, then save. Examples:

   ![Redirect URL Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80719066/202246758-b0472b8c-b03f-44fc-8e1a-c161c7746a93.png)

4. Click 'Show Client Secret'.
5. Copy/paste the Client ID into `CLIENT_ID` and the Secret Client ID into `SECRET_CLIENT_ID` within your `.env` file.

   ![Client ID Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80719066/202246004-f7307806-69ec-4489-975b-beb71e6637b3.png)

### Google Sheets/GSpread (Optional)
1. Sign into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), create your APP, and enable Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs.
2. Go to API & Services -> Credentials -> Create Credentials -> Service Account. Follow the prompts and download the JSON file afterward.
3. Open Google Sheets and create a new file named 'Wrapped365'. Add tabs named 'short_term', 'medium_term', 'long_term', 'short_term Artists', 'medium_term Artists', and 'long_term Artists'.
4. Share the Google Sheet Document with the email of your service account, giving editor permissions. The email can be found in Google's Cloud Console Credentials or within the downloaded JSON file, resembling something like: `wrapped-test@wrapped-test943892.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
