### Spotify Developer Credentials (Required)
1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in with your Spotify credentials.
2. Create a new application. Choose a name, provide a description (optional), and accept the Terms of Service.
3. In the 'Edit Settings' section, add the redirect URL from your `.env` file, then save. Example:
   
   ![Redirect URL Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80719066/202246758-b0472b8c-b03f-44fc-8e1a-c161c7746a93.png)

4. Click 'Show Client Secret'.
5. Copy the Client ID and paste it into the `CLIENT_ID` field in your `.env` file. Similarly, copy the Client Secret and paste it into the `SECRET_CLIENT_ID` field.

   ![Client ID Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80719066/202246004-f7307806-69ec-4489-975b-beb71e6637b3.png)


### Google Sheets/GSpread (Optional)
1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), create a new project, and enable the Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs.
2. Navigate to **API & Services > Credentials**, then click **Create Credentials > Service Account**. Follow the prompts and download the resulting JSON file.
3. In Google Sheets, create a new file named 'Wrapped365'. Add the following tabs: `short_term`, `medium_term`, `long_term`, `short_term Artists`, `medium_term Artists`, `long_term Artists`.
4. Share the Google Sheet with the service account‚Äôs email (found in the downloaded JSON file or under the Google Cloud Console **Credentials** section). Grant it **Editor** permissions. The email will look like: `wrapped-test@wrapped-test943892.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
