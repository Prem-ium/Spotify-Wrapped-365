#### Final Remarks
How to Get Spotify Wrapped. 365 days a year. While everyone else google searches 'how to see / check / find spotify wrapped' you'll have access to your top played tracks and artists all year long! 

As previously mentioned however, I strongly recommend utilizing this repository using a service such as [Replit](https://replit.com/) & [UpTimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) as they will allow you the program to run without any computer resource cost to you. 

Beyond that, thank you for your interest in this repository. Please leave a ðŸŒŸ & share with your friends!
